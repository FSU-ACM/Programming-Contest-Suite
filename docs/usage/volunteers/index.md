# Welcome to the Volunteer Manual!

Any user with an account role of `Docent`, `Proctor`, `Question Writer`, or `Contest Organizer` is considered a Contest Volunteer. The particular role a volunteer has allows access to additional features and tools. All volunteers are given access to the contest's check-in interfaces. Contest Organizers have access to additional features detailed in the [Contest Administration]({{ site.url }}/usage/volunteers/contest_administration/) section.

### Volunteer Roles

- **Docent**  
    Assists with check-in, preparing/serving food, or any other activity required to host a contest
- **Proctor**  
    Monitors spaces where contestants complete to enforce adherance to contest rules. Also answers basic questions and clarifications from contestants.
- **Question Writer**  
    Writes one or more questions used in a contest.  Also offers question clarifications to contestants for the duration of the contest.
- **Contest Organizer**  
    Helps plan, coordinate, and host the contest. Typically manages question writers, proctors, docents, and high level contest details.
