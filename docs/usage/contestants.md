## Pre-Contest

{: .important-title }
> Registration Deadline
>
> A registration deadline will appear on the site'e homepage once it is confirmed by the contest's organizers. This date and time specifies the *Team Registration Deadline* after which point contest team creation is frozen. You may still join and/or leave registered teams after this deadline.

### Contest Teams

In order to receive log-in credentials to the contest server on the day of the contest, you are required to be a member of a team. Teams may have 1-3 members, each of whom must register an account. You have the option of joining a team which has already been registered, or registering a new team.

#### Team Division

Each team registered with a contest competes in one of two divisions: Upper or Lower. The Lower division problems are easier and intended for newer programmers, while the Upper Division problems are intended for those with 2+ semesters of programming experience.

{: .warning-title }
> Mixed Divisions
>
> A team's assigned division applies to *all* team members. In other words, if you want to participate in the Lower Division then you cannot be a member of a team in the Upper Division, and vice versa.

### Join a team

To join a team which is already registered with a contest, first click the *Join registered team* button located in the center of the Team section of your Account Dashboard.

Click the *Submit* button to finalize your team's registration. Upon successfully registering a team, you will receive team admin privileges. 

### Team administration

As a team administrator, you have the ability to manage a team's details and membership, as well as delete the team entirely. If you choose to leave the team, your admin privileges will be automatically assigned to one of the team's other members.
