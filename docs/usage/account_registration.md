## Introduction

Registering an account is the first step toward participating in a semester's programming contest either as a contestant or volunteer. Account registration only requires your first and last name, a valid email address, a username, and a suitably strong password.

> A Registration Deadline will appear on the site'e homepage once it is confirmed by the contest's organizers. This date and time specifies the *Team Registration Deadline* after which point contest team creation is frozen. You may still register an account, and join/leave registered teams after this deadline.

## Registration Form

A link to the account registration interface is accessible from the site's navbar when you access the site while not logged in. The interface may be accessed directly by navigating to `<site_url>/register/`.
