# Faculty Teams

The PCS supports designating a registered team as a *Faculty Team*, which are teams comprised of one or more faculty members. Use the *Designate Faculty Team* utility in the *Tools* section on the [Contest Dashboard]({{ site.url }}/usage/contest_administration/contest_dashboard.html) to change a team's status.

Once a team is assigned faculty status, it is displayed in the Faculty Teams table on the *Teams* page. A team from either division may be assigned faculty status, and the team will participate in it's registered division.
