## Volunteer Roles

After registering a PCS account, a contest volunteer is assigned one of the PCS user profile roles that most closely corresponds to their duties. 

- **Docent**  
    Assists with check-in, preparing/serving food, or any other activity required to host a contest.
- **Proctor**  
    Responsible for monitoring contestants and answering basic questions while the contest is active.
- **Question Writer**  
    Writes one or more questions used in the contest packets, and offers question clarifications to contestants for the duration of the contest.
- **Contest Organizer**  
    Helps plan, coordinate, and host the contest. Typically involves managing question writers, proctors, docents, and important contest details.

## Managing roles

User roles are managed with the utility in the *Update User Role* section on the [Contest Dashboard]({{ site.url }}/usage/contest_administration/contest_dashboard.html).

> The User Role system does not grant a user Django Administration privileges. These privileges must be assigned separately through Django Administration.

## Voluteer check-in

The [Volunteer Check-in]({{ site.url }}/usage/volunteers.html#volunteer-check-in) interface is a dedicated portal for contest volunteers to check in. The *Volunteer pin* attribute of a contest specifies the passcode volunteers use to complete volunteer check-in. The interface may be accessed by any user with a volunteer role, allowing a contest volunteer to complete check-in whenever they are provided the passcode.
