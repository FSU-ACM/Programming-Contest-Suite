# Walk-in Teams

Walk-in teams are empty teams that are registered in the PCS database and imported into DOMjudge. They allow users who missed the team registration deadline to still participate in a programming contest.  Walk-in teams are registered using the *Create Walk-in teams* utility in *Contest Tools* section on the [Contest Dashboard]({{ site.url }}/usage/contest_administration/contest_dashboard.html).
