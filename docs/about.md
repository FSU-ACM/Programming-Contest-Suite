# About 

The Programming Contest Suite (PCS) is a set of tools for running [ICPC](https://icpc.global) style programming contests hosted by the [Association for Computing Machinery Florida State University Student Chapter](https://fsu.acm.org) (ACM@FSU). The suite is designed to work alongside a [DOMjudge](https://www.domjudge.org/) jury system by facilitating contest registration and management, generating contestant data files required by DOMjudge, and processing contest results generated by DOMjudge.

## Motivation

This project is the successor to [FSU-ACM/Contest-Server](https://github.com/FSU-ACM/Contest-Server), a Flask based ACM@FSU Programming Contest registration server created by [Andrew Sosa](https://github.com/andrewsosa). The PCS was intended to:

1. Address the limitations of FSU-ACM/Contest-Server
2. Enhance and ease engagement with administrators, contestants, volunteers and university faculty 
3. Provide a codebase maintainable by student, and often newer, developers

## Development

The project was initially developed between early 2020 and its first live deployment for the 2021 Fall Programming Contest. It has since been under active development and maintenance, with management of the project being transferred to ACM@FSU in early 2024.

## The Contest

The ACM@FSU Programming Contest is held each Spring and Fall semester at [Florida State University](https://www.fsu.edu). It routinely attracts 300-500 contestants, many of whom are FSU Computer Science students, and is actively supported by Computer Science Department faculty.
