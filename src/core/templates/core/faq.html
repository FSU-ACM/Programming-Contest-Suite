        The contest is a series of challenging coding questions
        that require critical thinking and coding know-how.
        Each question has a prompt consisting of flavor text and a
        description of the challenge. You'll get the some constraints
        on the input, as well as some sample input and corresponding output.
        From there, your team will need to work together to write code that
        will produce the correct output for any input we could throw at you.
        Responses are scored on how quickly you solved the problem relative
        to the contest with points deducted for each incorrect submission.

        As our contest has grown almost ten-fold over the past five years,
        we want to allow less experienced participants to still be competitive.
        If you are currently enrolled in COP3014/COP3363(Intro to C++) or
        COP3330 (Object Oriented Programming), you qualify to register for
        the Lower Division. The Lower Division will have easier questions
        better suited for less experienced programmers.
        The Upper Division will cater to the highest levels of technincal talent;
        participants include undergraduate seniors, Ph.D students, and even
        department faculty.

        We recommend some early programming experience in one of our
        supported languages: C/C++, Java, Python, Perl, C#, and Javascript.
        You'll have access to official language documentation, but that's it.

            Teams are ranked by the number of questions they have solved. If multiple teams have answered the same number of questions, then they are ranked by a point system based on least total time to submit a correct solution for the questions, as well as fewest attempts to get the correct solution.
          </li>
          <li>
            You receive points when you successfully solve a problem, and the amount of points is based on how many minutes since the contest has started. For every incorrect solution you submit, you receive a penalty of 20 minutes to your final score for that problem. You may submit as many times as you like, but EACH incorrect solution will add additional time penalties. For example, if you submit a correct solution to a problem 10 minutes after the contest has started, but submitted an incorrect solution beforehand, then your final score will be 30.
          </li>
          <li>
            Teams who answer the same number of questions will be ranked on the lowest score, since it is based on time since the contest has started + time penalties per questions. This also means that you could have a "lower" score than another team who is ranked higher, however they solved more questions than your team, thus putting them ahead.

          Don't worry! We add courses only as we receive confirmation from the course instructor. If your course isn't listed, first confirm with your instructor that they are indeed offering extra credit for participation. If they are, and have sent our team a confirmation, then please be patient as our contest admin team is small! We will post annoucements as new courses are added.
