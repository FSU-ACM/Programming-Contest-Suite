	<h3>So how does this contest thing work?</h3>
</div>
<div class="container pt-3 my-3 border d-flex justify-content-center">
	  The contest is a series of challenging coding questions
    that require critical thinking and coding know-how.
    <br>
    <br>
    Each question has a prompt consisting of flavor text and a
    description of the challenge. You'll get the some constraints
    on the input, as well as some sample input and corresponding output.
    From there, your team will need to work together to write code that
    will produce the correct output for any input we could throw at you.
    <br>
    <br>
    Responses are scored on how quickly you solved the problem relative
    to the contest with points deducted for each incorrect submission.

	<h3>How do these divisions work?</h3>
</div>
<div class="container pt-3 my-3 border d-flex justify-content-center">
	  As our contest has grown almost ten-fold over the past five years,
    we want to allow less experienced participants to still be competitive.
    <br>
    <br>
    If you are currently enrolled in COP3014/COP3363(Intro to C++) or
    COP3330 (Object Oriented Programming), you qualify to register for
    the Lower Division. The Lower Division will have easier questions
    better suited for less experienced programmers.
    The Upper Division will cater to the highest levels of technincal talent;
    participants include undergraduate seniors, Ph.D students, and even
    department faculty.
