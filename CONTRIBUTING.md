## Testing & Development Server 

`deploy/dev/docker-compose.yml` contains an example deployment intended for [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) and suitable for local testing and development. 

If you are running the development deployment for the first time, or have made any changes to the project's Celery tasks, run:  

    docker compose build  

Launch the project:  

    docker compose up

NOTE: In order to monitor the debug logs, as well as view any emails the system sends while in debug, it is suggested to NOT use the `-d` flag with the `docker compose up` command.

## Documentation

All project documentation is located in `docs/`. We utilize the [Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/) Jekyll theme to style our documentation in Github Pages.

## Versioning

We use something similar to [SemVer](https://semver.org/):

  - MAJOR version for significant codebase rewrites.
  - MINOR version for localized changes, e.g. adding a new feature.
  - PATCH version for any adjustment to `main` codebase, e.g. bugfix.
