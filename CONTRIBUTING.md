# How to contribute to Programming Contest Suite
Thanks for your interest in contributing to the project!

## Versioning
We use something similar to [SemVer](https://semver.org/):

  - MAJOR version for significant codebase rewrites.
  - MINOR version for localized changes, e.g. adding a new feature.
  - PATCH version for any adjustment to `master` codebase, e.g. bugfix.
